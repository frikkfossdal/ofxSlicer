# ofxSlicer

A slicer for doing parallel processing in additive manufacturing. 

## Some background

As I am currently researching parallel processing in additive manufacturing, I figured that it would be nice to have my own slicer. My motivations for building my own custom one is motivated by both practical needs and a need to really understand how 3-dimentional geometry works in a computer.  

### Philosophy 

If you want to learn more about the project and the movitation behind it, I´ve included much more information about this in another repo [here](https://github.com/frikkfossdal/fluffy-octo-potato).  Just to give some quick context, the main objective is to distribute the toolpaths generated by the slicer between multiple extruders working concurrently on the same object.

## The Slicer

The algorithms behind the slicer is mostly motivated by the work presented in this [paper.](http://www.dainf.ct.utfpr.edu.br/%7Emurilo/public/CAD-slicing.pdf) In the paper, the authors claims that they have developed a slicing algorithm that is time-wise optimal compared to other slicing algorithms known in litterature. The authors has also published their C++ code 

The slicing algorithm goes something like this:

1. Create a list containing all triangles of the mesh model.
2. Mesh slicing:  Calculate triangle intersection points on each plane.
3. Construct contours: Create polygons from the intersection points
4. Make sence of the polygons (Clockwice/Counterclockwise)

Full disclaimer. I´m new to C++, and by no means an expert in programming. I wanted to keep close track on how the memory is used and allocated by the slicer. Based on this I decided that C++ would be an optimal choise of language.  I´m also having a really alright time with Openframeworks. 

### Getting the triangles 

Getting the triangles was a bit of a struggle in Openframeworks. To import .stl files, I use the [ofxAssimpModelLoader](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxAssimpModelLoader/ofxAssimpModelLoader/) addon in openframeworks.  It took some tweaking to get the triangle faces, with it´s belonging vertices, extracted from the assimp class. All the triangles are sorted in ascending order in terms of the lowest point in the triangle. I´ve commented this in the code. NOTE: It would probaly be easier to use some kind of existing C++ framework for geometry like CGAL, but not as much fun! 

### Calculate the triangle intersections 

Once we have the triangles it´s time to calculate the intersection points on each layer. 

TODO: post seudo code.

I basically have three diferent situations. 
1. The triangle is located on the topside of the layer plane 
2. The triangle is intersecting with the plane. 
3. The triangle is underneath the plane. This means that the slicer is finished processing it.

### Active triangles 

To improve the speed of the algorithm the triangles that are finished processed are removed from the triangle list that is used in the calculation. This condition applies when the entire triangle is located underneath the layer plane. See figure. 

TODO. Add figure 

### Creating the toolpaths

Once the triangle intersection algorithm has swept trough all of the triangles I basically have a bunch of layers containing intersection points. From this, I want to create a set of polygons that essentially is my toolpaths. To find the polygons, the paper suggest to create a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table).
